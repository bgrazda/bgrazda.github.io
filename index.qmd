Hi! My name is Brooke Grazda. I am a San Diego native currently based in Santa Barbara, California. I am an environmental data scientist focused on using programming tools to help inform the efficacy of environmental policy. Keep reading for a little bit more about me!

I am currently a Masters of Environmental Data Science student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. Previously, I graduated from UC Santa Barbara (UCSB) with a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies and a minor in Applied Psychology. While taking interdisciplinary coursework in food, water, and energy, I struggled to narrow down my interests into one singular niche. Rather, I understood that I was passionate about applying technical skills to environmental problem solving with natural resources. 

During my undergrad, I worked at the Institute for Energy Efficiency (IEE) at UCSB as an administrative and marketing student assistant. At IEE, I became fascinated by all the different applications of STEM research to increase energy efficiency. The importance of science communication in combating the climate crisis stood out to me significantly. I was curious to figure out ways to bridge the gap between technical science jargon and the general public's understanding of environmental solutions. In many instances, data science seemed to be my answer.

I studied tropical biology and conservation while abroad in Costa Rica, and conducted an independent research project. My research project collected and analyzed the threatened behaviors of reef fish located in the Cuajiniquil Bay, and was a catalyst for pursuing environmental data science. 

Prior to starting my graduate program, I worked in my hometown as an environmental educator at a local nonprofit, I Love A Clean San Diego. Here, I resonated deeply with their mission of waste reduction, outreach, and conservation. 

I am committed to use data driven solutions to educate the public and effectively manage natural resources. I am currently an Environmental Resources Management Intern at the County of Santa Barbara Public Works Department in the Resource Recovery & Waste Management Division. My long term goals are to use data science as a tool to inform policy and advocate for environmental justice. Check out some of my projects!
