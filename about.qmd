## Who am I

I'm Brooke, and I am an aspiring environmental data science! My love for nature comes from my upbringing in San Diego, California. Growing up, I have always loved music, art, theatre, and being outdoors. I never imagined that I would go into such a rigorous and technical field, but here we are and loving it!

## My career, so far

My current role is a data-meshed administrative role, where I support The 2035 Initiative's policy research through data validation and administrative correspondence. I work directly under Dr. Leah Stokes, and am looking to pursue a professional career in data analysis.

I am committed to solve environmental problems through data driven solutions. I worked previously as an Environmental Resources Management Intern at the County of Santa Barbara Public Works Department in the Resource Recovery & Waste Management Division. I worked directly with SB 1383, ensuring compliance in Santa Barbara. Scroll below to see more information about this bill!

Prior to my graduate degree, I was an environmental educator for a nonprofit in San Diego, delivering presentations and assemblies to students of all ages. These presentations covered topics such as watershed pollution prevention, the role of sea otters within kelp forest ecosystems, food waste, and household hazardous waste. Here, I resonated deeply with their mission of waste reduction, outreach, and environmental protection.

During my undergrad, I worked at the Institute for Energy Efficiency (IEE) at UCSB as an administrative and marketing student assistant. At IEE, I became fascinated by all the different applications of STEM research to increase energy efficiency. The importance of science communication in combating the climate crisis stood out to me significantly. I was curious to figure out ways to bridge the gap between technical science jargon and the general public's understanding of environmental solutions. In almost every instance, data science seemed to be my answer.

## What inspires me

Nature, community, and collaboration. I possess a growth mindset to develop practical solutions through a unique approach of combining data analysis and science communication with developing interpersonal relationships. I believe in reaching beyond barriers and connection to foster productive learning environments. My vision is to collaborate with stakeholders to create equitable solutions necessary to increase equitable access to our most basic needs using data driven strategies.

## What I'm working on

I'm currently working on building an interactive dashboard using RShiny as a labor advocacy tool for the Central Coast. This analysis models the impact of decarbonization on labor markets. This tool will be hosted by the 2035 Initiative and UCSB Community Labor Project. 


## What is SB 1383?

California State Bill 1383 calls for a 75% reduction statewide in disposal of organic waste by 2025. I worked for the County of Santa Barbara Public Works Department in the Resource Recovery and Waste Management Division, working to meet these goals. SB 1383 also madates that 20% of disposed edible food be recovered by 2025. This means all hands on deck! Counties across the state are working to divert organic waste through green bins, recycled food programs, educational presentations in schools, and much, much, more. 


Business, residents, and waste haulers are all doing our part to divert our organic waste. Find out more [here](https://lessismore.org/).
